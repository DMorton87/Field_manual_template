# Field_manual_template
This is an Obsidian template (markup) for a pentesting field manual, originally designed by Bruno Rochamoura for the CPTS exam. It contains no information, just folders and empty notes for you to add your own content.
I didn't invent this, but I painstakingly recreated it based on the the brilliant template provided by Bruno Rochamoura. I hiackghly recommend checking out his blog entry on the subject and watching the HackSmarter presentation that he did for a livestream. Behold the links below.
