# Field_manual_template
This is an Obsidian template (markup) for a pentesting field manual, originally designed by Bruno Rochamoura for the CPTS exam. 
It contains no information, just folders and empty notes for you to add your own content.
I didn't invent this, but I built it based on the file tree pictured below. 
I highly recommend checking out his blog entry on the subject and watching his HackSmarter presentation.
